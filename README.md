# Pi-StopGPIOTest
python and Scratch Raspberry Pi GPIO tests using Pi-Stop from 4tronix

Simple code using 3 LEDS on Pi-Stop to quickly test if th GPIO pins are working using python and Scratch on the Raspberry Pi.

Attach the Pi-Stop as follows

GND - GND (Pin 6)
Green - BCM 14 (Pin 8)
Amber - BCM 15 (Pin 10)
Red - BCM 18 (Pin 12)

All these 4 pins are together so the Pi-Stop will slot right on.

If you don't have a Pi-Stop then with the GPIO Pins you could wire up 3 LEDs to these pins and the code will also work.
